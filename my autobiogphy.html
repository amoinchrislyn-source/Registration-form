      <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
      <p>
        Hello! I'm <strong>Chris Lyn L. Amoin</strong>,And I am currently a student at Lapu-Lapu City College taking up 
        Bachelor of Industrial Technology, major in Computer Technology. 
        I’m a motivated and curious learner who believes that education is the key to success. 
        Aside from studying, I also manage a small business to help my parents with daily needs 
        and school expenses for my siblings.
      </p>

      <h3>Education</h3>
      <p><strong>2025 - Present:</strong> Lapu-Lapu City College – Bachelor of Industrial Technology, Major in Computer Technology.</p>
      <p><strong>Previous:</strong> Babag 1 National High School – Senior High School under TVL-ICT (Contact Center Services).</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">EARLY EDUCATION</h2>
      <p>
            My academic journey began at Kalawisan Elementary School. Even as a young child, I showed a strong passion and talent for the Arts. 
        I loved drawing, painting, and creating crafts, often spending extra time perfecting my artworks beyond classroom activities. 
        My teachers noticed my creativity and dedication, and I was recognized as one of the best in Arts at our school. 
         Their encouragement inspired me to continue improving my skills and express myself through art.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">INTERESTS AND HOBBIES</h2>
      <p>
        Aside from academics, I have always had a passion for crocheting. I started learning this craft at a young age and quickly fell in love with the process 
      of creating something beautiful and useful out of simple yarn. Crocheting allows me to express my creativity, patience, and focus while also giving me 
      a sense of relaxation and accomplishment. Over time, I’ve made various handmade pieces such as bags, accessories, and small gifts for friends and family, 
     which has become one of my favorite pastimes.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title">CHALLENGES AND OVERCOMING THEM</h2>
      <p>
        Like every student, my academic path has not been without challenges. Balancing studies, extracurricular activities, and personal life
        has sometimes been overwhelming. However, I've learned to manage my time effectively through planning and prioritization, which has
        significantly eased my stress and improved my productivity.
      </p>

      <h3>MY JOURNEY & LEARNINGS</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout my studies, I’ve learned that success doesn’t come from being the smartest or the luckiest, 
        but from having determination, kindness, and faith in yourself. 
        Every challenge I face makes me stronger and pushes me closer to my dreams.
      </p>


      <h3>GOALS & ASPIRATIONS</h3>
      <p>
        My dream is to become a successful IT professional and businesswoman who can inspire others. 
        I want to help my family live a better life and be the first successful woman in our family. 
        I may not be perfect, but I always strive to do my best and keep moving forward.
